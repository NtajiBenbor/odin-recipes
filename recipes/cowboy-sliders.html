    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These cowboy sliders are filled with saucy, well-seasoned ground round, Cheddar cheese, bacon, and jalapenos, so gooey and good, you may not want to share.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground round</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls, cut in half horizontally, without separating individual rolls</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, cooked until crisp</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno, thinly sliced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crispy fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook while crumbling with a spoon until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire, and stir. Add barbecue sauce and stir until well combined. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Place bottom half of Hawaiian rolls on a small rimmed baking sheet. Top with half of the shredded cheese. Top with meat mixture, bacon, jalapenos, crispy onions, and remaining cheese. Place top half of rolls on top and cover the pan with foil. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are toasted and cheese is melted and gooey, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
